# ZohoAPI
In this repository I will provide useful information to work with API's in many Zoho applications, such as Creator, CRM and many more by using their new Oauth2 api.
Everything here is made in Python by using the "requests" module along with the "json" module.
In case of any doubt presented on the repository please contact me at my number +52 8711897822 or at my email pedro.emilio.tr@gmail.com :)
